DESCRIPTION
This is a minimum viable product for a Savings calculator app.

Currently it calculates the time it will take to save a user set amount of money if they would save a set amount every week or month.

It simply works by calculating the total amount minus the initial amount divided by the amount you save each period.

NEXT STEPS

-Format the returned value in a more readable string.
-Implement safety methods to make sure the values passed are always a number.
-Adding an interest rate to the savings.
-Adding a new operation to show how much you'd save over a certain period of time(no end sum provided).
